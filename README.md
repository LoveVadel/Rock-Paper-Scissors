# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors is my first javascript project and for the first part, it will be played on the browser  console. The game will be played by a human player vs computer.

The project was later completed and now has a user interface which enables players to make their choices by clicking of the desired button ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.
